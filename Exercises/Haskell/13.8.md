# Exercise 13.8

Consider the following functions:

```hs
id       :: i -> i
curry    :: ((a, b) -> c) -> a -> b -> c
uncurry  :: (d -> e -> f) -> ((d, e) -> f)
```

```
curry id              ::  a -> b -> (a, b)
uncurry id            ::  (e -> f, e) -> f
curry (curry id)      ::
uncurry (uncurry id)  ::
uncurry curry         ::
```
