# Exercise 13.10

The parameters `(x:xs)` and `(y:ys)` means that xs and ys is arrays. Also, because it is possible to order `x` and `y`, they are instances of `Ord` and of same type `a`. Then, `merge` simply returns an array of type `a`. Thus, the definition becomes

```hs
merge :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
```
