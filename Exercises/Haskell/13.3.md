# Exercise 13.3

To be able to unify function `g :: a -> [a]` with `f :: b -> c` to give function `h :: Bool -> Bool`, type of `c` must be equal to that of `a`. If type of `b` and `a` is boolean, `g . f` will yield the desired output.

```hs
g :: Bool -> [Bool]
...

f :: Bool -> Bool
...

h :: Bool -> [Bool]
h = g . f
```
