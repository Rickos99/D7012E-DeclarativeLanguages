# Exercise 13.1

**a)**
type of `n` is `Bool` and integers and boolean types cannot be used together in the `(+)` function.

```hs
f n     = 37 + n
f True  = 34
```

**b)**
`g :: Int -> ..` can only have one return type, not both `Int` and `Bool`.

```hs
g 0 = 37
g n = True
```

**c)**
function `h` can only have one return type, not both `Int` and `Bool`.

```hs
h x
  | x > 0      = True
  | otherwise  = 37
```

**d)**
the order of patterns matter and because the first line `k x = 34` match every value of `x`, the second line will be redundant.

```hs
k x = 34
k 0 = 35
```
