> `?- big( X), dark( X).`

1. Call `big(X)`. Clause 1 matches
2. Call `dark(bear)`. Clause 7 matches.
3. Call `black(bear)`. No match is found and it fails.
4. Call `dark(bear)` again. Clause 8 matches.
5. Call `brown(bear)`. Clause 4 matches and the goal is met, and thus the goal `dark(bear)` is met.
6. One result is `X = bear`.
7. Try again to find another match, call `big(X)`. Clause 2 matches.
8. Call `dark(elephant)`. Clause 7 matches.
9. Call `black(elephant)`. No match is found and it fails.
10. Call `dark(elephant)` again. Clause 8 matches.
11. Call `brown(elephant)`. No match is found an it fails.

> `?- dark( X), big( X).`

1. Call `dark(X)`. Clause 7 matches.
2. Call `black(X)`. Clause 5 matches.
3. Call `big(cat)`. No match is found and it fails.
4. Move to next match for call `dark(X)`, clause 8.
5. Call `brown(X)` again. Clause 4 matches.
6. Call `big(bear)`. Clause 1 matches.
7. The result is `X = bear`.

The latter is more effective in terms of the number of calls prolog makes before all answers are found.
